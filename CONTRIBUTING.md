## Is a feature missing?

You can *request* a new feature on [github issues](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm/issues).
If you want to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with
First a proposal for your work, to be sure we can use it.
Please consider what type of exchange it is:

- For a **Main Feature**, first open an issue and describe your proposal so it can be
discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, avoid duplication of work,
and help you design the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.
- **Small features** can be designed and submitted directly [submitted as a pull request] (#submit-pr).
