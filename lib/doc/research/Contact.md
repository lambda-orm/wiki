**Message to offer me to work in an ORM:**

Hello.
I am interested in working on projects related to data management and especially in ORMs.
I have been developing an ORM called [λORM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambdaorm) in TypeScript, but which can be consumed from CLI or Rest Api.

I hope it meets your expectations and can work for you.

From already thank you very much.
